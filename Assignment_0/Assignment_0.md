Answer 1: In 1959 Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed".He proved concepts of ML using a checker game.
Answer 2: According to Tom M.Mitchell “Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that allow computer programs to automatically improve through experience".He provides a more modern way to describe ML as “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.”
Answer 3:I would suggest to take up problem of population prediction for next 50 years for a particular region. This can be solved by the above used concept of ML.Providing the computer with population data of past several years (experience E) for future prediction of population task (T).We check the performance P and observe it getting accurate with a plotted trend. Hence increasing the performance of prediction of population in future.
